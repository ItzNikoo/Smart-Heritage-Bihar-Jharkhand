          <h2>Geography</h2>
          <p>Hundru Falls are located on the course of the Subarnarekha River where it falls from a height of 98 metres (322 ft), creating one of the highest waterfalls in the state. The spectacular scene of the waterfalls has been described as "a sight to behold". The different formations of rock due to the erosion by the constantly falling of water have added to the beauty of the place.
              Hundru Falls, located at one of the edges of the Ranchi plateau, is one of the several scarp falls in the region. During the rainy season it takes a formidable form, but in the dry season it turns into an exciting picnic spot. At the base of the falls is a pool that serves as a bathing place.
              Hundru Falls is an example of a knickpoint, caused by rejuvenation. A knickpoint, also called a nick point or simply nick, represents a break in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river. The break in channel gradient allows water to fall vertically, giving rise to a waterfall.</p>
          <h2>Transport</h2>
          <p>To reach Hundru Falls, one has to travel about 21 kilometres (13 mi) from the main road, Purulia Road.
            There is also a shortcut and simple four-lane road from Ranchi via Ormanjhi via Sikidiri to Hundru. From this road the distance is about 39 kilometres (24 mi) which is about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) short from the normal road.
            There is also a Suvarna Rekha Hydral Project located down the falls, which is a good place for tourists.</p>
